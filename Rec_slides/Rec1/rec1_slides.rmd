# Dominant Strategy Equilibrium
<!-- .bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-2.ph2.mt2[

**Nash equilibrium**

At an equilibrium, each player's strategy is a best response to the others (or no player has a profitable deviation).
]  -->


Other than Nash equilibrium, there is another type of equilibrium called **dominant strategy equilibrium**, which could be used to make fairly compelling predictions about games.

## Example: Prisoner's Dilemma

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo1.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]

Is there any (weekly/strictly) dominant strategy for each player? Can you find a dominant equilibrium?



---
class: middle

.content-box-green[**Nash equilibrium v.s. Dominant equilibrium**]

+ For a Nash equilibrium, each player needs to predict what the opponent's optimal strategy is. 
+ For a dominant equilibrium, each player only cares about their optimal strategies and doesn't care what the opponent's best strategy is. 

<br>

.content-box-green[**NOTE**]

In many games, however, one or more players do not have dominant strategies. In that case, we cannot derive an equilibrium using the dominant strategies approach...

# Iterated Strict Dominance

.content-box-green[**Idea:**]

A rational player always plays the dominant strategy (if it exists) no matter what the opponents might do. 

In other words, <span style="color:blue">no rational player should ever play a strictly dominated strategy.</span> 

<br>

.content-box-green[**Procedure**]

Repeat to eliminate strictly dominated strategies.

class: middle
## Example

This is the game you did in the class this Wednesday. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_1.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]

+ Is there any strictly dominant strategy for each player? (Recall that strictly dominant strategy is the best strategy no matter what the opponent may play.)

+ Is there any <span style="color:blue">strictly dominated strategy</span>?

---
class: middle
## Example

This is the game you did as an in-class game in this Wednesday. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_1.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]

+ Is there any strictly dominant strategy for each player? (Recall that strictly dominant strategies is the best strategy no matter what the opponent may play.)

<span style="color:blue">No.</span>

+ Is there any <span style="color:blue">strictly dominated strategy</span>?

<span style="color:blue">Yes!</span>

class: middle

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_1.png")
```

But there is a strictly dominated strategy. 

<br>

No matter what Player 1 may play, Player 2 always gets a higher payoff from Playing R than from Playing C. 

&rarr; Because <span style="color:blue">C is strictly dominated by R for player 2</span>, a rational player 2 will not play C. 

&rarr; If player 1 knows that player 2 is rational then player 1 can eliminate the possibility that player 2 plays C.

class: middle

Now the games looks like this. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_2.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]

Is there any strictly dominated strategy?



---
class: middle

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_2.png")
```

No matter what player 2 plays, player 1 gets a higher payoff from playing U than from playing M or D. 

&rarr; Because <span style="color:blue">M and D are strictly dominated by U for player 1</span>, a rational player 1 will not play M and D. 

&rarr; If player 2 knows that player 1 is rational then player 2 can eliminate the possibility that player 1 plays M or D. 



---
class: middle

Now the game looks like this. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/photo2_3.png")
```

<span style="color:blue">For palyer 2, R is strictly dominated by L.</span>

Thus, iterated strict dominance predicts $(s_1, s_2)=(U, L)$.

???
+ The table is further narrowed down, and we can easily see that R is strictly dominated by L for player 2. 
+ As a result, iterated strict dominance finds that (U, L) is the outcome of this game.

.content-box-green[**NOTE:**]

If there are no strictly dominated strategies to be eliminated (i.e. all the strategies in the game survive), iterated strict dominance fails to yield a prediction.

.content-box-green[**Nash equilibrium v.s. Iterated strict dominance**]

Gibbsons P.7-8

> Nash equilibrium is a stronger solution concept than iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, in the sense that the player' strategies in a Nash equilibrium always survive iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, but the converse is not true.

# Example Problem 1 (Discrete strategies):

Bob and Ray are driving in opposite directions down a road that narrows down to a single lane to cross a river.  Each player can either maintain speed (M) or slow down (S). Players choose their strategy simultaneously one time (static game of complete information). If both players maintain speed they will crash on the bridge and each get a payoff of -8.  If one player maintains speed and the other slows down the player maintaining speed gets a payoff of 3 while the other player gets a payoff of 0.  If both players slow down, they each get a payoff of 1.  

(1) Write down the strategy set of each player.

(2) Write down the normal form for this game.

(3) Find **all** Nash equilibria for this game.

# Example Problem 2 (Continuous strategies):

Two players are deciding how to split $1. They simultaneously put in a bid for how much of the dollar they will receive, $s_i$, $i = 1, 2$.  If the sum of the bids is less than or equal to $1 then each player receives their bid. If the sum of the bids is more than $1 then both players receive a payoff of 0. 

(1) Write down the payoff function for each player as a function of strategies.

(2) Find the best response function for each player.

(3) Find all pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game.
