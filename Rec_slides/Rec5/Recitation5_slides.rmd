# Spring 2023 Finall Problem 1

Consider the following signaling game shown in the figure below, where player 1 can be of two types and chooses to play $L$ or $R$. Player 2 initially does not know whether player 1 is of type $t1$ or type $t2$, only the initial probabilities. Player 2 observes the choice of L or R and may update probabilities of types based on the choice by player 1. Player 2 then chooses $U$ or $D$. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/ex1.png")
``` 

a.  Find all pure strategy perfect Bayesian equilibria for this game.

<br>

Problem 1 has three questions. Next week, we will work on questions (b) and (c). Question (b) is related to the intuitive criterion.

# Set up

I will use the following notations. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/setup.png")
```

Define:

Player 2's belief: $p=Pr[t_1|L]$ and $q=Pr[t_1|R]$

Player 1's strategy: $(s_1^{t1}, s_1^{t2})$, Player 2's strategy: $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})$

???
+ I will use the following notations. $p$ and $q$ are the player 2's belief (in terms of probability) about player 1's type given player 1's signal. For example, $p$ is the player 2's belief that player 1 is type 1 after observing player 1 plays L.

step 0: Write out the possible strategies for player 1 (signal sender).

step 0: Write out the set of strategies for  player 1 (signal sender).


Player 1's strategy: 

$$(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2}) \in \{\underbrace{(L, R), (R, L)}_\text{Separating strategies}, \underbrace{(L, L), (R, R)}_\text{Pooling strategies}\}$$

## Case I: Separating Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$

<b>Step 1:</b> Suppose that player 1 plays a separating strategy $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$ at equilibrium. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_1.png")
``` 

 <b>Step 2:</b> What should player 2's beliefs be? What is the player 2's BR to Player 1's strategy?

Player 2's beliefs are $p=1$ and $q=0$. Given these beliefs, player 2's BR is $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})=(D, D)$.

+ Step 1, we assume that ...
+ The blue line shows the assumed player 1's strategy. 
+ Then in step2, given the separating sestrategy of player 1, we need to specifcy the player 2's beliefs, and his BR to player 1's strategy. 

+ What should player 2's belief be?

## Case I: Separating Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$

We found that player 2's BR is $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})=(D, D)$.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_3.png")
``` 

<b>Step 3:</b> Given player 2's BR, what is player 1's BR? Is it consistent with what we assumed for this equilibrium?

+ Player 1's BR is $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$ (oops, type 2 would rather play $L$ than $R$!) 

**Conclusion**: There is no separating equilibrium as such.

## Case III: Pooling Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$

<b>Step 1:</b> Suppose that player 1 plays a pooling strategy $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$ at equilibrium. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_5.png")
```

<b>Step 2:</b> Player 2's beliefs are $p=0.5$ and $q \in [0,1]$. Given these beliefs, what is Player 2's BR to Player 1's strategy?

## Case III: Pooling Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "70%"}

.content-box-green[If player 1 plays L]

\begin{align*}
\text{Player 2's expected payoffs} =
    \begin{cases}
0 \cdot 1/2 + 1 \cdot 1/2 = 1/2 &\quad \text{by playing U} \\
2 \cdot 1/2 + 0 \cdot 1/2 = 1 &\quad \text{by playing D}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

So, player 2's BR when player 1 plays L is $s_2^{L}=D$

## Case III: Pooling Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_7.png")
```

.content-box-green[If player 1 plays R]

\begin{align*}
\text{Player 2's expected payoffs} =
    \begin{cases}
2 \cdot q + 0 \cdot (1-q) = 2q &\quad \text{by playing U} \\
0 \cdot q + 1 \cdot (1-q) = 1-q &\quad \text{by playing D}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

So, 

\begin{align*}
\text{Player 2's BR correspondence} =
    \begin{cases}
    U  \quad & \text{ if } \, q > 1/3 \\
    U \text{ or } D &\text{ if } \, q = 1/3 \\
    D &\text{ if } \, q < 1/3

## Case III: Pooling Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_8.png")
```

<b>Step 3:</b> Given Player 2's BR, what is Player 1's BR? Any profitable deviation from what we assumed?

+ For type 1, playing $L$ yields payoff of $1$. <span style="color:blue">But, type 1 can get higher payoff of 3 by playing $R$ (if player 2's belief is $q > 1/3$). Playing $L$ is type 1's BR if $q \leq 1/3$</span>

+ Similarly, for type 2, playing $L$ is the BR if $q \leq 1/3$.

**Conclusion**: Thus, PBE is  $\{L, L; D, D; p=0.5, q \leq 1/3 \}$
