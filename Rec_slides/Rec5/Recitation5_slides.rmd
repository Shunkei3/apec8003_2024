step 1: 
+ What's the Player 1's strategy?: 
  + Separating or pooling strategy 

step 2: 
+ What believes are consistent with Player 1's strategy.

Given those beliefs, what's the player 2's best response?

step 3: 
Given player 2's strategy, think about the player 1's strategy. 

Is it consisistent with Player 1's strategy we set in step 1? If not, there is no PBNE as such.

# Spring 2023 Finall Problem 1

Consider the following signaling game shown in the figure below, where player 1 can be of two types and chooses to play $L$ or $R$. Player 2 initially does not know whether player 1 is of type $t1$ or type $t2$, only the initial probabilities. Player 2 observes the choice of L or R and may update probabilities of types based on the choice by player 1. Player 2 then chooses $U$ or $D$. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/ex1.png")
``` 

a.  Find all pure strategy perfect Bayesian equilibria for this game.

<br>

Problem 1 has three questions. Next week, we will work on the question (b) and (c). Question (b) is related to the intuitive criterion.

step 0: Write out the player 1's and player 2's possible strategies, repsectively.

Player 1's strategy: 

(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2}) = {(U, L)}
