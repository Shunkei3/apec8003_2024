Two requirements to apply the Intuitive Criterion:

(1) The information set following $a_i$ is off the equilibrium path.

(2) $a_i$ is equilibrium dominated for type $t_i$ but not not all types.

You found that PBE are 

(i) $\{(L, R), (DL, DR), p = 1, q = 0\}$

(ii) $\{(L, L), (DL, UR), p = 1/2, q= 3/7\}$

<br>

Which of the PBE satisfy the Intuitive Criterion?

<br>

There is no off the equilibrium path. 

&rarr; The Intuitive Criterion will not impose any restrictions on Player B (signal receiver)'s belief &rarr; The intuitive Criterion

<br>

``` 

1. Is there any off the equilibrium path? &rarr; Yes. The information set following $R$ is off the equilibrium path. 

2. Check whether $R$ is equilibrium dominated for type $t_i$ but not not all types. 

+ For type 1, $R$ is equilibrium dominated. 
+ For type 2, $R$ is not equilibrium dominated. 

<span style="color:blue">Intuitive Criterion activates! 
</span>

&rarr; Player B must believe $q=P[t_1|R]=0$ &rarr; contradiction (because the pooling equilibrium says that $q= 3/7$) &rarr; Case (ii) equilibrium does not satisfy the Intuitive Criterion.

# Exercise: Spring 2020 Final, Problem 1 (continued)

Consider the following signaling game shown in the figure below, where player 1 can be of two types and chooses to play $L$ or $R$. Player 2 initially does not know whether player 1 is of type $t1$ or type $t2$, only the initial probabilities. Player 2 observes the choice of L or R and may update probabilities of types based on the choice by player 1. Player 2 then chooses $U$ or $D$. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./photos/excer0.png")
``` 

In the previous recitation, you found that the pure strategy PBE are (i) $\{R, L; U, U; p=0, q \leq 1 \}$, (ii) $\{L, L; D, D; p=0.5, q \leq 1/3 \}$, and (iii) $\{R, R; D, U; p \ge 1/3, q=0.5\}$.

**Incentive Compatibility Constraint**: 

An Equilibrium strategy must be a best response:

If the equilibrium strategy for $t=H$ is $e_H$, then 
$$w(e_H) - c(H, e_H) \ge w(e) - c(H, e) \quad \forall e \neq e_H$$

If the equilibrium strategy for $t=L$ is $e_L$, then 
$$w(e_L) - c(L, e_L) \ge w(e) - c(L, e) \quad \forall e \neq e_L$$

]

 This is the constraint to assure that there is no profitable deviation for each player from the equilibrium. 

???
+ Actually, we applied the incentive compatibility constraint to the signaling game we did. 
+ so, this is not a special thing. 
+ We use this to narrow down the potential equilibrium outcomes.

## Spring 2019 Final, Problem 3 (continued)

Suppose there are two types of workers, high productivity types $(t = H)$ and low productivity types $(t = L)$.  A worker knows her type but a firm that is seeking to hire a worker does not. The probability of a worker being high productivity is $p_H  = 2/3$ and the probability of a low productivity type $p_L= 1/3$. A worker chooses an education level, $e \ge 0$, which is observable to firms.  The cost of education for a high type worker is: $c(H,e)=e^2$. The cost of education for a low type worker is: $c(L,e)=1.5e^2$. After observing the education level, firms offer wage contracts w(e) that specifies wages as a function of education. Assume that the output of a high type worker is: $y(H,e)=6+3e$ and the output of a low type worker is: $y(L,e)=6$.  The payoff for worker is: $w – c(t, e)$.  The payoff for a firm is: $y(t, e) - w$ .  Assume that firms are competitive so that they pay workers a wage equal to expected productivity: $w(e)=p(H│e)y(H,e)+p(L│e)y(L│e)$, where $p(x|e)$ is the conditional probability of the type $x$ ($x = H$ or $L$) given observed level of education $e$.

## Pooling equilibrium: $(s_1^{H},s_1^{L})=(e_p, e_p)$

<b> Then, firm's beliefs </b>: 

+ $P(H|e_p)=2/3$.
+ $P(H|e \neq e_p)$ is off the equilibrium path, so it can be anything. Assume $P(H|e \neq e_p)=0$ so that choice of $e \neq e_p$ is unattractive. 

<b> Given these beliefs, what is the firm's BR? </b>

According to the wage equation,
\begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  \text{If observing } e=e_p \text{, pay} \, w(e_p)=6 +2e_p \\
  \text{If observing } e \neq e_p \text{, pay} \, w(e\neq e_p)=6
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

<b> Given the firm's BR, what is the worker's BR? (use Incentive Compatibility Constraint)</b>

First, if the worker plays $e \neq e_p$, which $e$ would a rational worker choose? &rarr $e=0$

For type $H$, it must be that 
\begin{align*}
&\quad \text{payoff from playing} e=e_p \ge \text{payoff from playing} e \neq e_p \\
\iff&\quad w(e_p) - c(H,e_p) \ge w(e \neq e_p) - c(H, 0) \\
\iff&\quad 6 +2e_p - e_p^2 \ge 6 - 0 \\
\iff&\quad e_p \leq 2  
\end{align*}


For type $L$, it must be that 
\begin{align*}
&\quad \text{payoff from playing} e=e_p \ge \text{payoff from playing} e \neq e_p \\
\iff&\quad w(e_p) - c(L,e_p) \ge w(e \neq e_p) - c(L, 0) \\
\iff&\quad 6 +2e_p - 1.5e_p^2 \ge 6 - 0 \\
\iff&\quad e_p \leq 4/3
\end{align*}

<b>Conclusion</b>: Pooling PBE is $\{e_p \in [0, 4/3];  w(e_p)=6 +2e_p, w(e\neq e_p)=6; P(H|e_p)=2/3, P(H|e \neq e_p)=0\}$.
