# Spring 2023 Finall Problem 1

Consider the following signaling game shown in the figure below, where player 1 can be of two types and chooses to play $L$ or $R$. Player 2 initially does not know whether player 1 is of type $t1$ or type $t2$, only the initial probabilities. Player 2 observes the choice of L or R and may update probabilities of types based on the choice by player 1. Player 2 then chooses $U$ or $D$. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}

``` 

a.  Find all pure strategy perfect Bayesian equilibria for this game.

<br>

Problem 1 has three questions. Next week, we will work on questions (b) and (c). Question (b) is related to the intuitive criterion. 

???
+ Let me work through how to solve this problem. 
+ There four possible pure strategy NE, two for pooling equilibrium and two for separating equilibrium. 
+ To let I am going to explain one pooling equilibrium and one separating equilibrium.

# Set up

I will use the following notations. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/setup.png")
```

Define:

Player 2's belief: $p=Pr[t_1|L]$ and $q=Pr[t_1|R]$

Player 1's strategy: $(s_1^{t1}, s_1^{t2})$, Player 2's strategy: $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})$

Player 1's payoff: $(u_1^{t1}, u_1^{t2})$

???
+ I will use the following notations. $p$ and $q$ are the player 2's belief (in terms of probability) about player 1's type given player 1's signal. For example, $p$ is the player 2's belief that player 1 is type 1 after observing player 1 plays L.

step 0: Write out the possible strategies for player 1 (signal sender).

step 0: Write out the player 1 (signal sender)'s possible strategies.


Player 1's strategy: 

$$(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2}) = \{\underbrace{(L, R), (R, L)}_\text{Separating strategies}, \underbrace{(L, L), (R, R)}_\text{Pooling strategies}\}$$

## Case I: Separating Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/I_1.png")
``` 

Suppose that player 1 plays a separating strategy $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$ at equilibrium. 

<b>(step 1)</b> What should player 2's beliefs be? What is the player 2's BR?

Player 2's beliefs are $p=1$ and $q=0$. Given these briefs, player 2's BR is $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})=(D, D)$.

## Case I: Separating Equilibrium $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, R)$

We found that player 2's BR is $(s_2^{L}, s_2^{R})=(D, D)$.

``` 

<b>(step 2)</b> Given player 2's BR, what is player 1's BR? Is it consistent with what we assumed for this equilibrium?

+ Player 1's BR is $(s_1^{t_1}, s_1^{t_2})=(L, L)$ (oops, Player 1 with type 2 would rather play $L$ than $R$!) 

&rarr; Conclusion: There is no separating equilibrium as such. 

???
+ The next question is what is player 1's BR given player 2's BR. 
+ For player 1 with type 1, we compare player 1's payoff of 1 by playing L, and payoff of 0 obtained by playing R. Obviously,

Let's practice. Find a pure strategy PBE for this case.

+ You should get $\{R,L; U, U; p=0, q=1\}$
