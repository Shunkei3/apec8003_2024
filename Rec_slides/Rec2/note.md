# Past Exams:

## Midterm Exam, Problem 1:

<b>2023</b>:  
+ Simple static game
  + Find all NE (both pure and mixed)
+ Simple dynamic game: 
  + Instead of simultaneous move, what if player 1 moves first? Find all SPNE (use the Backword induction)

<b>2022</b>: 
+ Simple static game
  + Find all pure strategy NE 
  + Dominant strategy equilibrium
  + Iterated strict dominance
+ Simple dynamic game:
  + Write down the set of strategies for each player. Find all SPNE

???
+ I wrote up the main topics of Problem 1 and 2 in the previous midterm exams. 
  + Probably Steve does not like it if he found that I am doing this. But, I think it's okay. 
  + The point here is that I wanted to make you guys relaxed by sharing the information about the test so that you can focus on preparing for the exam with peaceful mind. 

+ Anyway, for problme 1, the main topic is commonly pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibirium, which we did last week's assignment and recialtation. 
  + In 2019 and 2020, dominant strategy and iterated strict dominance  were asked, so it might be better to review those topics before the test.

class: middle

<b>2020</b>:
+ Mix of dynamic and static game
  + Find pure strategy NE for the part of static game. 
  + Find pure strategy SPNE.


<b>2019</b>:
+ Simple static game
  + Find all NE
  + Dominant strategy equilibrium
  + Iterated strict dominance
  + Is a dominant strategy equilibrium a NE? Is the solution derived by iterated strict dominance a NE?

class: middle

## Midterm Exam, Problem 2:

<b>2023</b>: 
+ Duopoly (n=2 firms)
  + Find the Cournot equilibrium
  + Find the Collusive outcome
  + Infinitely repeated game (trigger strategy)
    + For what values of $\delta$ is it possible to for supporting collusive outcome as a SPPE?
  
<b>2022</b>: 
+ Similar to Problem 1
  + Simple static game
  + Simple dynamic game

???
+ This is the topics about Problem 2 in the previous midterms. Problem 2 are mostly about strategic interaction of oligopoly. It looks like the story is almost the same, like what is the Cournot outcome, and what is the collusive outcomes, and so on.

class: middle

<b>2020</b>:
+ Oligopoly (n=3 firms)
+ Find the Cournot equilibrium
+ Find the Collusive outcome
+ Infinitely repeated game (trigger strategy)
  + For what values of $\delta$ is it possible to for supporting collusive outcome as a SPPE?

<b>2019</b>:
+ Oligopoly (n=N firms): Find the Cournot equilibrium
+ n=3 firms, Two stage game. In stage 1, firm 1 can make an investment. In stage 2, firms compete as Cournot oligopolists. What is the optimal choice of K for firm 1 in stage 1? 

???
+ I don't know what kind of question will be asked this year. I am suspecting that Hotteling model of spatial competition would be asked, but I don't know.
