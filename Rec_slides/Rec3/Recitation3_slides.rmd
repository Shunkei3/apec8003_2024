<b>Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium</b>

Definition: A set of strategies is a subgame Nash equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibirium in all subgames.

+ Okay, last week, we covered dynamic game. 
+ What is a dynamic game? Well, it is a game such tht players move sequentially or repeatedly. 
+ We can find NE, but not all the predictions of NE is credible. Some NE are non credible threats. 
+ So, as a refinment of conventinal NE, we use new equilibirumm concept called subgame Nash equilibrium. Okay?

# Exercise Problem 1 (Midterm 2020)

Consider the extensive form game in Figure 1.  The first payoff in parentheses is player 1’s, while the second is player 2’s.  

(a).  Write down the strategies for each player.

(b).  Find all Nash equilibria for the subgame starting with player 2 after player 1 has chosen $R$. 

(c).  Write down the normal form version of this game.

(d).  What are the pure strategy Nash equilibria for the complete game?

**(e)**.  What are the pure strategy subgame perfect Nash equilibria for the complete game?

+ I solved problems in midterm and final exams many times in preparing for the prelim, and actually it helped me a lot.
+ The problems I brought today are one of my favorite problems from the past exams, actually when you start to solve past prelim exams, you will see similar problems.  

+ I like this problem because you can practice both static and dynamic game of complete information at the same time. 
  + As you can see from this game tree, this part is dynamic game, but this part is static game. Interesting!
+ Also, the similar game looks like this has been on prelim multiple times.  

+ The main thing that I want to make sure you know is how to write down a set of strategies for each player in a dynamic game.

# Exercise Problem 2 (Midterm 2020)

Three firms compete as Cournot oligopolists. Let $q_i$ be the quantity produced by firm $i$, $i = 1, 2, 3$. The market inverse demand curve is given by $P(Q)=30-Q$, where $P$ is market price and $Q$ is quantity, with $Q=\sum_{i=1}^3 q_i$. Each firm has a cost function given by: $C(q_i)=6q_i$. 

(a). Solve for the Cournot equilibrium. Solve for the profit made by each firm in Cournot equilibrium.

(b). Suppose the firms collude to maximize joint profits and share profit equally by each producing $1/3$ of the monopoly output. How much does each firm produce? What is the profit of each firm?

(c). Suppose the three firms compete in an infinitely repeated game. Suppose that $\delta$ is the discount factor between each stage of the repeated game. For what values of $\delta$ is it possible to support the collusive outcome as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game?

???
+ For part (c), such a strategy is called "trigger strategy".
