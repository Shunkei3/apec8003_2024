# Midterm exam, Problem 3

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

???
+ Today, we gonna review problem 3 from the midterm exam. 
+ Recently, I have been going over time, so I'll try to finish before 3:50.

<b>Problem:</b>
+ Players: Monocorp (monopoly) and Rocky (monopsony)
+ Rocky's utility (measured in monetary terms) is 
\begin{align*}
U(H) = 
    \begin{cases}
    10H - H^2/2  \quad & \text{ if } \, 0 \leq H \leq 10 \\
    0 &\text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
+ Inverse demand function: $P(H) = 10 - H$
+ Monocorp's cost function: $C = 30$ (zero marginal cost)
] 

(a) Find the profit maximizing (linear) price per hour assuming that cable
television is provided to Frostbite Falls. How much profit would
Monocorp make if it provided cable television to Frostbite Falls? Would
Monocorp choose to supply cable television to Frostbite Falls?

.content-box-red[**Profit maximization problem for Monocorp (monopoly)**]
$$\max_{H} \pi =(10-H)H-30.$$ 
Then, $H^{\ast}=5$.  Monocorp's profit is $\pi^{\ast}=-5<0$. So, Monocorp would rather choose not to provide cable TV. 

???
+ Okay, summarizing problem 3, there are two players, Monocorp and Rochy. This is the Rocky's utility function and this is the inverse demand function. 

+ The question a is easy. We just need to solve for profit maximization problem for Monocorp. The profit is negative so, Monocorp would not provide TV.

] 

(b) Suppose instead of choosing a simple linear price, Monocorp sets a two-part
tariff: $T(H) =A+ PH$. Solve for the profit maximizing two-part
tariff. How much profit would Monocorp make if it provided cable
television? Would Monocorp choose to supply cable television?

<br>

.content-box-red[**Standard solution for Two-part tariff**]
\begin{aligned}
\max \quad & A + PH - 30 \\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & A + PH \leq \int_{0}^{H} (10-h) dh
\end{aligned}

???
+ Question (b) is asking about two-part tariff problme for Monocorop. As we did in the last recilation, the standard approach for the this problme is to solve for the profit maximization with the constraint that the monopoly's revenew is less than the potential consumer surplus.

```

+ The monopoly sets per-unit fee $P$ at the competitive price $(\text{i.e., }P=MC=0)$ 

&rarr; $CS$ is maximized. 

+ Then, the monopoly extracts all the $CS$ by setting the lump-sum fee $A$ equal to $CS$.

<br>

.content-box-green[**What's the consequence for Rocky?**]
+ <span style="color:blue">Since CS is zero, this means Rocky is indifferent between watching cable TV and not. 
</span>

???
+ Just like I showed in the last recitation, you can intuitively understand the mechanism of the two-part tarrif wit this figure. 

+ First, the monopoly sets price at the competitive price. In this case, the marginal cost is zero, so the competitive price is zero. This results in maximized CS. 

+ Then, the monopoly extract all the consumer surplus by setting the lump-sum fee A equals to CS. 

+ This pricing scheme results in positive profit for Monocorp. 


+ Consumer surplus is the difference between willingness to pay for a good and the price that consumers actually pay for it. Each price along a demand curve also represents a consumer's marginal benefit of each unit of consumption. The difference between a consumer's marginal benefit for a unit of consumption, and what they actually pay, represents how much benefit a consumer gets from the price they are paying
  + **Note:**: Marginal benefit is the maximum amount a consumer will pay for one additional good or service

] 

(c) Suppose that Rocky offers to pay Monocorp a fixed amount, B, that allows
Rocky to watch as much cable television as Rocky wants. How much
television should Rocky watch to maximize utility? What is the utility
maximizing amount that Rocky should offer to pay Monocorp?

.content-box-red[**Rocky's utility maximization**]

$$\begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}
\max \quad & U = 10H - H^2/2 - B\\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & B \ge 30 \\
\end{aligned}\end{equation*}$$

&rarr; $H=10$ and $B=30$, $U=10\cdot10 - 10^2/2 - 30 = 20$.

???
+ Question (c) is asking about how much TV Rocky would watch to maximize his utility. 
+ So, we set up utility maximization problme in a usual way. 
+ Since Rocky needs to pay for some fixed fee, we need to substract $B$ from Rocky's utility. 
+ Also, we need a condition that Rocky has to at least pay the fixed cost that Monocorp incures. This assures that Monocorp provides their service and Rocky can get positive benefit from the service.

] 

(d) Monocorp and Rocky engage in a bargaining game. They both agree to
bargain on the size of a fixed payment from Rocky to Monocorp that lets
Rocky watch as much cable television as he wants. Suppose that
Monocorp makes the first offer, which Rqcky accepts or rejects. If Rocky
rejects the offer, then in the next period Rocky makes an offer, which
Monocorp accepts or rejects. If Monocorp rejects the offer, then in the
next period Monocorp makes an offer. If Rocky rejects this offer, both
players get a payoff of $0$. The discount factor between periods is $\delta = 0.5$. Solve for the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for this bargaining game.


???
+ Okay, question (d). This is the main question for this problem. This is a three stage bargaining game. First, Monocorp offer the fixed fee, and Rocky decises wherther to accept or reject the offer. If Rocky rejects the offer, then Rocky offers the fixed fee, and Monocorp chooses wherther to accept or not. If Monocorp rejects, in the final round, Monocorp offers and Rocky decides. If Rocky does not like Monocorp's final offer, then both get payoff of zero.

## 3rd period:

.content-box-green[(1) Ricky's best response to Rocky's offer B]

Ricky compares the payoffs from accepting $(\Pi_M(B))$ and rejecting $(0)$. 

\begin{align*}
br_R(B_1) = 
    \begin{cases}
    \text{accept} \quad & \text{ if } \, B_1 < 50 \\
    \text{indifferent between accepting and rejecting} \quad & \text{ if } \, B_1=50 \\
    \text{reject} \quad & \text{ if } \, B_1 > 50 \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

<br>

.content-box-green[(2) Monocorp's best response to Ricky's strategy]

+ To offer $B_1=50$ (profit maximizing fixed payment).
  + or $50-\varepsilon$

<br>

<span style="color:blue">The NE for 3rd period</span>: Monocorp offers $B_1=50$ and Rocky accepts.

$\Pi_{R}(B_1) = 5$ &rarr; $40 - B_1 = 5$ &rarr; $B_1=45$


<span style="color:blue">The NE for 2nd period</span>: Rocky offers $B_1=45$ and Rocky accepts.
