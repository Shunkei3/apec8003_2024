(a) Find the profit maximizing (linear) price per hour assuming that cable
television is provided to Frostbite Falls. How much profit would
Monocorp make if it provided cable television to Frostbite Falls? Would
Monocorp choose to supply cable television to Frostbite Falls?

.content-box-red[**Profit maximization problem for Monocorp (monopoly)**]
$$\max_{H} \pi =(10-H)H-30.$$
Then, $H^{\ast}=5$.  Monocorp's profit is $\pi^{\ast}=-5<0$. So, Monocorp would rather choose not to provide cable TV.

(b) Suppose instead of choosing a simple linear price, Monocorp sets a two-part
tariff: $T(H) =A+ PH$. Solve for the profit maximizing two-part
tariff. How much profit would Monocorp make if it provided cable
television? Would Monocorp choose to supply cable television?

(c) Suppose that Rocky offers to pay Monocorp a fixed amount, B, that allows
Rocky to watch as much cable television as Rocky wants. How much
television should Rocky watch to maximize utility? What is the utility
maximizing amount that Rocky should offer to pay Monocorp?

(d) Monocorp and Rocky engage in a bargaining game. They both agree to
bargain on the size of a fixed payment from Rocky to Monocorp that lets
Rocky watch as much cable television as he wants. Suppose that
Monocorp makes the first offer, which Rqcky accepts or rejects. If Rocky
rejects the offer, then in the next period Rocky makes an offer, which
Monocorp accepts or rejects. If Monocorp rejects the offer, then in the
next period Monocorp makes an offer. If Rocky rejects this offer, both
players get a payoff of $0$. The discount factor between periods is $\delta = 0.5$. Solve for the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for this bargaining game.

## 3rd period:

.content-box-green[(1) Ricky's best response to Rocky's offer B]

Ricky compares the payoffs from accepting $(\Pi_M(B))$ and rejecting $(0)$.

\begin{align*}
br_R(B_1) =
    \begin{cases}
    \text{accept} \quad & \text{ if } \, B_1 < 50 \\
