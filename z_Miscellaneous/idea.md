# Recitation 1

## Plan
+ Strategy to survive game theory

+ Static game (complete game)
	* pure strategy
	* mix strategy

+ Normal form (or matrix form)


+ Definition of a Nash Equilibrium
	* single equilibrium? -> pure strategy NE
	* multiple equilibria -> mixed strategies NE

	* Sometimes only a pure strategy NE exists, sometimes only a mixed strateygy NE exists. Sometimes, there both a pure strategy NE and a mixed strategy NE esist. 


## 
+ Definition of **strategy**:
	* "A strategy for a player is a complete plan on how the player will play the game: it specifies what action the player will choose *at every instant in the game* where the palyer has a chice of actions."

+ A Nash equilibrium occurs where both players are palying a best response. 


+ Why mixed strategy happens?
